</div>

To run the project locally first clone the repo in your preferred directory using your terminal: 

git clone git@github.com:endfros/tukan-brain-teaser.git

Once it is cloned you have to move to the directory of the cloned repo:

cd tukan-brain-teaser

Now you have to install the dependencies using npm: 

npm install

Now you can run the app using the following command:

npm run dev

It will show on the terminal the local URL, you can access that URL pasting the direction on your browser. 
Now you can use the app! :)
